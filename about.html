    <h1>  ABOUT US</h1>
    <p>  When a program works with an input file, a special value known as a read position is 
        internally maintained for that file. A file’s read position marks the location of the next 
        item that will be read from the file. When an input file is opened, its read position is initially set to the first item in the file. As items are read from the file, the read position 
        moves forward, toward the end of the file. Let’s see how this works in the previous code 
        sample (from the Student Names project) After the statement in line 10 executes, the read 
        position for the Students.txt file is positioned as shown in Figure 5-30. You may know that HTML
